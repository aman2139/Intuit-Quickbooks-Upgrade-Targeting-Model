# Intuit-Quickbooks-Upgrade-Targeting-Model

### Intuit QuickBooks Upgrade Analysis

#### Project Overview

This project aimed to develop a predictive model to identify small businesses likely to respond to an offer to upgrade to QuickBooks version 3.0. Utilizing data from a wave-1 mailing campaign, our goal was to maximize the effectiveness of Intuit's wave-2 mailing campaign. Advanced predictive modeling techniques, including Logistic Regression and Neural Networks, were employed to analyze business interactions, purchasing history, and prior campaign responses.

#### Objective

The primary objective was to refine the selection process for the wave-2 mailing, aiming to increase response rates and maximize the campaignâ€™s overall effectiveness and profitability. This involved evaluating different classifiers, performing extensive hyperparameter tuning, and enhancing model accuracy.
